<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Umeboshi onigiri is a traditional Japanese rice ball or rice triangle typically filled with a pickled plum (ume) at its center. The pickled plum provides a tangy, sour, and salty contrast to the seasoned sushi rice, creating a unique and flavorful combination. Ume onigiri is a popular snack or lunch option in Japan and is often wrapped in a sheet of nori seaweed for added texture and flavor.</p>
